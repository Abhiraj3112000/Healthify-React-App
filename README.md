## Things to remember
1) Dark/Light Mode Switch + autodarkmode
2) Try to find out what kind of components have to be added according to the type of disease
3) Machine Learning implementation-
   The model would filter the keywords out of the patient's entered information and would 
   search those keywords in a text file where diseases would be mapped to the symptoms and then
   return the disease(s) which correspond to those keywords to the user and advise him to take
   consequent steps.
   Also in addition x-ray image recognition can be added.
   If the model by any chance cannot comprehend the disease from the users entered data, then
   it should display a message to re-enter the information correctly.
   
4) Run the following in command line after cloning the project to compile it-

   npm i 

   <!-- npm install --save react-spinners
   
   npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0

   npm i firebase

   npm i react-router-dom -->
